# Data readers for segmentation datasets

Check 'main.py' to see how to read the datasets.
Set paths for saving pre-processed datasets in 'datapaths.py'

So far, this repository contains code for reading the following datasets:

Brain datasets:
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>HCP (http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/) [labels generated via FreeSurfer]. For this dataset, there are T1w and T2w images for each subject.</li>
  <li>ABIDE (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). This dataset contains T1w images from several scanners. So far, we have pre-processed the data from two of these - Caltech and Stanford. Labels have been generated via FreeSurfer. </li>
</ul>
